title: "ITCR-bioconductor Overview"
---

- This proposal details the expansion of the core Bioconductor software infrastructure by focusing on these key aims:
    - **First**, maintain and expand infrastructure for multimodal experiments and spatial transcriptomics, and connect the R/Bioconductor ecosystem with non-R image analysis tools to facilitate statistical analysis of histopathology images in the context of spatial transcriptomics and other molecular data.
    - **Second**, transition Bioconductorâ€™s data and annotation-sharing tools to a federated, language-agnostic system that facilitates contribution and extension by the community, improves findability, enables automated improvement in metadata, and enhances utility for non-R users.
    - **Third**, create curated and integrated data repositories that make key datasets more findable and usable, and drive the development of the planned new data-sharing systems.
    - **Finally**, develop a program of user training and new outreach approaches to support the training of users and developers, including the creation of a large language model-based chatbot and a cloud-based platform with persistent disks for courses and workshops.
